# E-commerce back-end

## I was motivated to create an E-commerce application as it would provide a service for utilizing connections .

## I built this application wanting to utilze the CRUD Operation and creating a layout for back-end transactions to function. 

* This back-end service would solve transactions being found, posted on the back-end, give the ability to update said post, as well as deleting the post in which case the CRUD operation would be neccessary.

* This application serves a great purpose for routing, since it can be used in future applications for connectivity.

* Finally the database can interact with back-end better than the previous applications

## I learned the CRUD Operation and its  usfullness developing this app.

## I learned how in the connections use in web services relate to the Operation of CRUD, such as making posts to a live service, updating the post and deletion of the posts

## This application stands out from my other applications as This site has Full CRUD deployment in the back-end so that it can be used in other applications
